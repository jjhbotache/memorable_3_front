# Project Title

This project is primarily designed as a learning tool for Redux and TypeScript. The main objectives are:

1. To gain a deeper understanding of Redux, a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
2. To reinforce knowledge of TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds types to the language.

By working on this project, we aim to improve our skills in managing application state using Redux and writing more robust code using TypeScript.
